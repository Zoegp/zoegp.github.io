  - excerpt: 'I am a 5th year PhD student working with [Dr. Jennifer Thaler](https://blogs.cornell.edu/thaler) at Cornell University. My research focuses on tritrophic interactions between plants, herbivorous insects, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Specifically, I work on the conditionality of this plant-fungus mutualism, and the biotic and abiotic factors that shape the plant’s susceptibility and resistance strategies to herbivory.<br /><br />As symbiotic fungi, mycorrhizae associate with the vast majority of land plants. By providing nutrients and water to the plant in exchange for carbon, they can alter a plant’s growth and survival, as well as its ability to defend itself from herbivores. Mycorrhizae and other mutualistic microbes will be invaluable in tackling the food security challenges that arise in a world with changing climate and growing populations.'
