  - excerpt: 'I am a postdoctoral scientist working with John Lill at George Washington University.  I am currently researching the ways that cicada outbreaks shift forest herbivore communities.<br /><br />My graduate research focused on tritrophic interactions between plants, herbivorous insects, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Specifically, I worked on the conditionality of this plant-fungus mutualism, and the biotic and abiotic factors that shape the plant’s susceptibility and resistance strategies to herbivory.'
