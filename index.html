		<p>I study tri-trophic interactions between plants, herbivorous insects, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). My research focuses on the conditionality of this plant-fungus mutualism, and the biotic and abiotic factors that shape the plantâ€™s susceptibility and resistance strategies to herbivory. </p> 
		<p>Mycorrhizae, symbiotic fungi, associate with the vast majority of land plants. By providing nutrients and water to the plant in exchange for carbon they can alter a plants growth and survival as well as their ability to defend themselves from herbivores. These, and other mutualistic microbes will be invaluable in tackling the food security challenges that arise in a world with changing climate and growing populations.
