	        <img src="assets/images/Example leaf.jpg" alt="Example leaf photo" style="width: 265px; display: block; margin: 0 30px 0 0"/>
	    	</div>

	        <p>LeafByte is best used with images like you see here: a leaf on a solid background without significant shadow. The background is much lighter than the leaf to clearly differentiate the two (LeafByte can also be used with light tissue on dark backgrounds). The leaf is surrounded by four dots, which constitute the scale. The scale's four dots make a square of known size, which gives a frame of reference both for determining absolute areas in an image and for correcting the image if it was taken at an angle (LeafByte can also be used without the scale, but you won't get absolute measurements or angle correction). The size of the scale is measured as the distance between two dots on the same side of the square, from dot center to dot center. You can download a document with scales of different sizes [here]; after printing a page, just measure exactly how large the scale ended up given your specific printer. LeafByte also works fine if you make your own scale marking, e.g. spray paint on a tarp for very large leaves. For best results, don't use a scale that's excessively larger than your samples, or else the samples will take up a very small portion of your images and have poor resolution.</p>

    	<div>
	        <div style="float: right;">
	        <img src="assets/images/Title screen.png" alt="LeafByte title screen" style="width: 265px; display: block; margin: 0 0 0 30px"/>
	    	</div>

	        <p>You'll see the title screen upon first opening LeafByte. From here, the standard way to proceed is with one of the two large buttons near the bottom, choosing whether you want to use an image that already exists or take a new photo. Alternatively, you can configure various <b>Settings</b> for LeafByte [link to later] in the top right or begin a <b>Tutorial</b> in the top left.</p>

	    	</div>

	        <p>After choosing an image or taking a photo, you'll begin with background removal. The goal is to leave just the leaf and scale markings. In short, LeafByte will attempt to do this automatically (and is generally effective if the leaf and scale are much darker than the background), but you can adjust the slider to tweak. What's happening is that LeafByte is looking at a histogram of brightnesses in the image. You'd expect this histogram to be bimodal with a mode at low intensities, representing the background, and a mode at high intensities, representing the leaf and scale. LeafByte finds an intensity between the two and removes everything below that intensity. The slider is actually allowing you to adjust that intensity, and the histogram you see above the slider is that histogram of intensities.</p>

	    	</div>

	        <p>Next is identifying the scale. LeafByte will automatically find all the shapes in the image and guess that the largest one is the leaf, and the next four largest are the scale dots. It'll mark those four scale markings with red Xs. If LeafByte did not accurately identify your scale dots, you can touch <b>Change Scale</b> and then touch each of the four scale dots. If your image does not have a scale at all, you can touch <b>No Scale</b></p>.
