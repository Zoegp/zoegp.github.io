							<i>Is LeafByte right for me?</i>
						</b>
						<br />
						<br />
					</font>

					<font size="4">
						<b>How much does it cost?</b>
					</font>
					<p>LeafByte is free.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>What devices does this app work on?</b>
					</font>
					<p>LeafByte is available on the <a href="#">App Store</a> for Apple devices that run iOS 9 and above. (The UX is optimized for iPhone 5 and later, but LeafByte also works on iPhone 3 and 4 and iPads.) Development of an Android version is being prioritized based on interest, so please <a href="mailto:leafbyte@zoegp.science?subject=Interest%20in%20LeafByte%20on%20Android&body=Hello,%0AI'd%20like%20to%20express%20my%20interest%20in%20using%20an%20Android%20version%20of%20LeafByte.%0A%0AThanks!">let us know</a> if you need an Android version.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>Does this work for all different leaf shapes?</b>
					</font>
					<p>LeafByte works for a wide variety of leaf shapes, including both simple and compound leaves. You can even measure petals and flat flowers. However, it may be difficult to use for plants with needles or lacy leaves like those in the Apiaceae family.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>How long does it take to measure each leaf?</b>
					</font>
					<p>The time to process a leaf depends on how much damage the leaf has and how simple the leaf image is. A simple leaf with no damage, or only internal damage will take about 10-15 seconds to process. However, compound leaves or leaves with significant damage on the margin can take 30 seconds to two minutes to process. If you are doing bioassays in the lab, it can be faster to just take before and after measurements with the app and completely avoid drawing margins.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>What barcodes are supported?</b>
					</font>
					<p>LeafByte can read standard linear and 2D barcodes. Supported 1D barcodes are Code 128, Code 39, Code 39 mod 43, Code 93, EAN-8, EAN-13 (including UPC-A), Interleaved 2 of 5 (ITF), ITF-14, and UPC-E. Supported 2D barcodes are Aztec, Data Matrix, PDF417, and QR.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>Can I use this for commercial plant monitoring?</b>
					</font>
					<p>Sure! LeafByte can be used for comperical plant health monitoring, academic research, home gardening, or any anything else you can imagine that requires measuring leaf area and herbivory. If you find LeafByte useful, we'd enjoy hearing!</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>How do I cite this in my paper?</b>
					</font>
					<p>TODO TODO TODO</p>
	
					<font size="4">
						<b>Can I use it in the field/non-destructively?</b>
					</font>
					<p>Yes! We recommend a clipboard with a background sheet and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07219ZSFT/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1"> clear matte screen protector</a> to hold the leaf flat.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>Can this be used to measure disease?</b>
					</font>
					<p>LeafByte was not designed to measure diseases. If your disease creates distinct white spots on a dark leaf, or very dark spots on a light leaf, LeafByte should be able to measure it. However, if the disease creates spots without a distinct separation between the diseased and un-diseased part of the leaf, LeafByte will have a hard time distinguishing and will give imprecise readings.</p>

							<i>Tips for Use</i>
						</b>
						<br />
						<br />
					</font>

					<font size="4">
						<b>What do I need to use LeafByte?</b>
					</font>

					<p>You will need a white background with 4 black dots in a square or a dark background with 4 white dots in a square. You can print a background <a href="assets/LeafByte%20Scale%20Dots.pdf">here</a>. We recommend a clipboard.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>My leaves are not flat. What can I do?</b>
					</font>
					<p>We recommend using a matte screen protector or acetate sheet such as those found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07219ZSFT/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1">here</a> to keep the leaf flat.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>Can I use LeafByte to measure the surface area of flowers, petals, or other leaf tissue?</b>
					</font>
					<p>Yes! If you are trying to measure light-colored leaf tissue such as white flower petals, you will need to use a black background with white dots and set <i>Use Black Background</i> in the Settings.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>What if most of the leaf was eaten?</b>
					</font>
					<p>LeafByte can’t tell where the leaf was after it's been eaten. It’s up to the user to draw in missing margins. If you are afraid most or all of the leaf will be eaten, we recommend taking before and after measurements and subtracting values to get leaf area consumed. This is often faster than drawing missing leaf margins in the app.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>What sizes of leaves can I use?</b>
					</font>
					<p>LeafByte can handle any leaves that you can photograph clearly. Some iOS devices can’t handle very tiny macro photography without a macro lense attachment. If you want to measure very large leaves like maize, consider a large white tarp with 4 dots in a square (which can be drawn on with a marker).</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>Why is saving sometimes slow?</b>
					</font>
					<p>There are two main reasons. 1) If you're saving to Google Drive and your internet is slow, saving will be slow. You can choose to save to the Files App on your phone to avoid using the internet. 2) Requesting phone GPS location can be slow in certain circumstances, so if you're saving GPS info, you may experience (sometimes intermittent) slowness. Disable <i>Save GPS Location</i> in Settings to speed things up.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>What does <i>Image may be fuzzy</i> mean?</b>
					</font>
					<p>This warning may be displayed on the background removal page if small adjustments to the slider would have significant effect on the image. This may indicate poor picture quality, perhaps due to low light, motion, or poor camera quality.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>I saved data or images to my phone, but I don't have have iOS 11, so I don't have the Files App. How do I get at my files?</b>
					</font>
					<p>You can use iTunes to get files to your computer regardless of your iOS version.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>How do I change which Google account my data is being saved to?</b>
					</font>
					<p>In the Settings, choose <i>Sign out of Google</i>, then re-select <i>Google Drive</i> as your save location. You'll be prompted to sign in again, and you can do so with your preferred account.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>Why does LeafByte keep trying to scan barcodes when I just want to take a picture?</b>
					</font>
					<p>LeafByte has an optional setting to scan a barcode before each photo, useful for folks who mark each sample with a barcode. To disable, go to the Settings and disable <i>Scan Barcodes</i>.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>LeafByte is removing the exact wrong part of my image!</b>
					</font>
					<p>This is probably because LeafByte is set to use a black background and you have a white background (or vice versa). In the Settings, toggle <i>Use Black Background</i>.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>I need help making a scale!</b>
					</font>
					<p>You can download a document with scales of different sizes <a href="assets/LeafByte%20Scale%20Dots.pdf">here</a>, or make your own (make four dots in a square). Just be sure to measure it before use, and enter the size in the Settings. Size is measured from the center of one dot to another along one side of the square.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>How do the calculations work?</b>
					</font>
					<p>TODO TODO Longs story short: Long explanation:</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>Why do you use 4 dots instead of a line for a scale?</b>
					</font>
					<p>Early iterations of LeafByte did use a single line as the scale. However, testing determined that photographing the leaf at even a seemgly reasonable angle could result in up to 40% distortion of the leaf’s absolute area. Having 4 dots in a square allows LeafByte to correct for most of the distortion from photographing at an angle. Now, taking the picture at even a 30 degree angle generally only leads to a 1-4% distortion of the leaf’s absolute area (due to seeing more shadow when at an angle).</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>I have an idea for how to improve the app! What should I do?</b>
						<br />
					</font>
					<p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:leafbyte@zoegp.science">leafbyte@zoegp.science</a>. We are always excited to hear new ideas. However, we are thoughtful about each new feature in order to keep the app simple, and time constraints mean that we can’t always add new features immediately. Shoot us an email, and we will see what we can do.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>I like this app, but I want to change it to fit my specific use case/idea/study system. Can I?</b>
					</font>
					<p>Yes! Please do. LeafByte is free and open source under the GPL-3.0 license. If you amend our app, we ask that you share the changes free and open source for the community to benefit from.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>Where can I find the code?</b>
					</font>
					<p>On <a href="https://github.com/akroy/leafbyte">GitHub</a>. Pull requests are welcome!</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>I’m having problems with the app. What should I do?</b>
					</font>
					<p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:leafbyte@zoegp.science">leafbyte@zoegp.science</a>. If the problem is a bug, please include your iOS version, device model, and exactly what actions you were performing in the app when the bug happened. Without this information, we will have a hard time fixing the bug.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>What data do you collect? What is LeafByte's privacy policy?</b>
					</font>
					<p>LeafByte itself gathers no data. We do not see or collect any information from or about your Google account. We do not see the pictures you take or the data you measure. We don't like creepy apps that gather data on you, so this certainly isn't one. (you can <a href="https://github.com/akroy/leafbyte">see all the code in LeafByte</a> if you want)</p>

					<p>Apple (not us) does gather some info about all apps in the App Store, such as usage info (e.g. how often is the app downloaded, does it get used) and crash reports (e.g. how many times did the app crash, what line of code did it crash on). We will likely be checking the crash reports to ensure LeafByte is not buggy and to fix bugs if they do occur. Note that these crash reports just tell us the line in our code; they don't tell us what you were doing or what data was involved.</p>

					<font size="4">
						<b>Who made this?</b>
					</font>
					<p>LeafByte was made by Zoe Getman-Pickering and Adam Campbell. Zoe is a PhD candidate at Cornell University with 6 pet mantids. Adam is a software engineer at Palantir. Nick Aflitto, Ari Greele, and Todd Ugine all contributed ideas for improvements and helped test the app. Julia Miller took photos for the tutorial.</p>
