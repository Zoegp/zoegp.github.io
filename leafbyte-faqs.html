		Basic Information </b><br /></font>
<font size="4">
<b>How much does it cost?</b><br /></font>
LeafByte is free and open source. 
<br /><br /><font size="4">	
<b>What devices does this app work on?</b><br /></font>
Currently this app is only available for apple devices that run ios9 and above. We recommend that you use an iphone 5 or later. While iphone 3 and 4, and ipads will run LeafByte, the aesthetics were designed for more the more recent iphones, so the layout may look a little funny. We are currently in the process of making a version for android.
<br /><br /><font size="4">	
<b>Does this work for all different leaf shapes?</b><br /></font>
LeafByte works for leaves that are simple or complex, as well as a wide variety of leaf shapes. However, it it is hard to use for very lacy leaves such as those in the apiaceae family or pine needles. 
<br /><br /><font size="4">
		<b>How long does it take to measure each leaf?</b><br /></font>
The time to process a leaf depends on how much damage the leaf has and how simple the leaf image is. A simple leaf with no damage, or only internal damage will take about 10-15 seconds to process. However, compound leaves, and leaves with a lot of damage on the margin can take 30 seconds to two minutes to process. If you are doing bioassays in the lab, it can be faster to just take before and after measurements with the app and skip the drawing completely. 
<br /><br /><font size="4">
	<b>What barcodes do you support?</b><br /></font>
We suport most 1D and 2 D barcodes. 1D barcodes include Code 128, Code 39, Code 39 Mod 43, Code 93, UPC-E, EAN-8, EAN-13, Interleaved 2 of 5, and ITF-14. We support 2D codes QR, Aztec, Data Matrix, and PDF417.
<br /><br /><font size="4">	
		
<br /><font size="4">				
<b>Can I use this for commercial plant monitoring?</b><br /></font>
Sure! This app can be used for comperical plant health monitoring, academic research, home gardening, or any anything else you can imagine that requires measuring leaf area and herbivory. 
<br />
<br />	<font size="4">
<b>How do I cite this in my paper?</b><br /></font>
Coming soon...
		<br />
<br /><font size="4">


<b>Can I use it in the field/non-destructively?</b><br /></font>
Yes! We recommend a clipboard with a background sheet and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07219ZSFT/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1"> clear matte screen protector </a> to hold the leaf flat in the field 
<br /><br /><font size="4">

		
		<br><b>Tips for use</b></br>
<b>What do I need to use this?</b><br /></font>
 You will  need a white background with 4 black dots in a square or a dark background with 4 white dots in a square. You can print them out here. We recommend a clipboard.
<br /><br /><font size="4">		
<b>My leaves are not flat. What can I do?</b><br /></font>
We recommend using a matte screen protector or acetate sheet such as those found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07219ZSFT/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1"> here </a> to keep the leaf flat. 
<br /><br /><font size="4">
<b>Can I use this to measure the surface area of flowers, petals or other leaf tissue?</b><br /></font>
Yes! If you are trying to measure light colored leaf tissue such as white flower petals you will need a black background with white dots. 
<br /><br /><font size="4">
<b>What if most of the leaf was eaten?</b><br /></font>
The app can’t tell where the leaf was after its been eaten. It’s up to the user to draw in missing margins. If you are afraid most or all of the leaf will be eaten, I recommend taking before and after measurements and subtracting values to get leaf area consumed. This is often faster than drawing missing leaf margins in the app.  
<br /><br /><font size="4">		
	<b>Can this be used to measure disease?</b><br /></font>
This app was not designed to measure diseases. If your disease creates distinct white spots on a dark leaf, or very dark spots on a light leaf, the app should be able to measure it fine. However, if the disease creates spots without a distinct separation between the diseased and un-diseased part of the leaf, the app will have a hard time distinguishing the healthy and diseased tissue. 
<br /><br /><font size="4">	
<b>What sizes of leaves can this handle?</b><br /></font>
The app can handle any leaves that you can photograph clearly. Some iOS devices can’t handle very tiny macro photography without a macro lense attachment. If you want to measure very large leaves like maize, you will need a large white tarp with 4 dots in a square (which can be drawn on with a marker).
<br /><br /><font size="4">
<b>Why is saving slow?</b><br /></font>
This is often because getting GPS location is slow. Disable it in settings to speed things up. However, if you are saving to google, slow internet can slow saving. Switch to saving locally to fix this.

<b>How do the calculations work?</b><br /></font>
Longs story short:
Long explanation:
<br /><br /><font size="4">
<b>Why do you use 4 dots instead of a line for a scale?</b><br /></font>
When we initially built the app, the plan was to use a single line as the scale. However, initial testing determined that photographing the leaf at an angle could result in a 20-40% distortion of the leaf’s absolute area. Having 4 dots in a square allows are app to correct for most of the distortion if you photograph your leaf at an angle. With the square method, taking the picture at a 30 degree angle can lead to a 1-4% distortion of the leaf’s absolute area.

		<br> Contacty stuff</br>
<b>I have an idea for how to improve the app! What should I do?</b><br /></font>
Send an email to leafbyte@zoegp.science. We are always happy to hear new ideas. However, space constraints can make it hard to add new buttons, and our time constraints mean that we can’t always add new features immediately. Shoot us an email, and we will see what we can do
<br /><br /><font size="4">
<b>I like this app, but I want to change it to fit my specific use case/idea/study system. Can I? </b><br />
</font>
Yes! Please do. LeafByte is free and open source under the GPL-3.0 license. If you amend our app, we ask that you share the changes free and open source for the community to benefit from. 
<br /><br /><font size="4">
<b>I’m having problems with the app. What should I do?</b><br /></font>
Send an email to leafbyte@zoegp.science. In the email you should include your operating system, device and exactly what actions you were performing in the app when it stopped working. Without this information, we will have a hard time fixing the bug.
<br /> <br /> <font size="4">
<b>What data do you collect?</b> <br /></font>
We are unable to see or collect information from your Google account. We do not see the pictures you processor the data you collect. If your app crashes, we get a report detailing what line of code the app failed on and what operating system and device you are using.
<br /><br /><font size="4">
<b>Who made this?</b><br /></font>
This was made by Zoe Getman-Pickering and Adam Campbell. Zoe is a PhD graduate student at a Cornell University who has 6 pet mantids.  Adam is a software engineer at Palantir. Nick Aflitto, Ari Greele, and Todd Ugine all contributed ideas for improvement and helped test the app.
